   Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and<br>
   does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of<br>
   Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or<br>
   other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related<br>
   information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no<br>

   <br>
   Using Creative Commons Public Licenses<br>
   <br>
   Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and<br>
   conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share<br>
   original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright<br>
   and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The<br>
   following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not<br>
   exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.<br>
   <br>
   Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are<br>
   intended for use by those authorized to give the public<br>
   permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by<br>
   copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are<br>
   irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms<br>
   and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.<br>
   Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before<br>
   applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the<br>
   material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any<br>
   material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-<br>
   licensed material, or material used under an exception or<br>
   limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:<br>
   wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors<br>
   <br>
   Considerations for the public: By using one of our public<br>
   licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the<br>
   licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If<br>
   the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for<br>
   example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to<br>
   copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our<br>
   licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain<br>
   other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of<br>
   the licensed material may still be restricted for other<br>
   reasons, including because others have copyright or other<br>
   rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,<br>
   such as asking that all changes be marked or described.<br>
   Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to<br>
   respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations<br>
   for the public:<br>

   Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0<br>
   International Public License<br>
   <br>
   By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree<br>
   to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons<br>
   Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public<br>
   License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be<br>
   interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in<br>
   consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the<br>
   Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the<br>
   Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under<br>
   these terms and conditions.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   Section 1 -- Definitions.<br>
   <br>
   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar<br>
   Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material<br>
   and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,<br>
   arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring<br>
   permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the<br>
   Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed<br>
   Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,<br>
   Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is<br>
   synched in timed relation with a moving image.<br>
   <br>
   b. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights<br>
   closely related to copyright including, without limitation,<br>
   performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database<br>
   Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or<br>
   categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights<br>
   specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar<br>
   Rights.<br>
   <br>
   c. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the<br>
   absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws<br>
   fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright<br>
   Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international<br>
   agreements.<br>
   <br>
   d. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or<br>
   any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights<br>
   that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.<br>
   <br>
   e. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,<br>
   or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public<br>
   License.<br>
   <br>
   f. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the<br>
   terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to<br>
   all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the<br>
   Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.<br>
   <br>
   g. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights<br>
   under this Public License.<br>
   <br>
   h. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards<br>
   commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of<br>
   this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for<br>
   other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital<br>
   file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is<br>
   no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the<br>
   exchange.<br>
   <br>
   i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or<br>
   process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such<br>
   as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,<br>
   dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material<br>
   available to the public including in ways that members of the<br>
   public may access the material from a place and at a time<br>
   individually chosen by them.<br>
   <br>
   j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright<br>
   resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of<br>
   the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,<br>
   as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially<br>
   equivalent rights anywhere in the world.<br>
   <br>
   k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights<br>
   under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   Section 2 -- Scope.<br>
   <br>
   a. License grant.<br>
   <br>
   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,<br>
   the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,<br>
   non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to<br>
   exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:<br>
   <br>
   a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or<br>
   in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and<br>
   <br>
   b. produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material<br>
   for NonCommercial purposes only.<br>
   <br>
   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where<br>
   Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public<br>
   License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with<br>
   its terms and conditions.<br>
   <br>
   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section<br>
   6(a).<br>
   <br>
   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The<br>
   Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in<br>
   all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,<br>
   and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The<br>
   Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or<br>
   authority to forbid You from making technical modifications<br>
   necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including<br>
   technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective<br>
   Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,<br>
   simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)<br>
   (4) never produces Adapted Material.<br>
   <br>
   5. Downstream recipients.<br>
   <br>
   a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every<br>
   recipient of the Licensed Material automatically<br>
   receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the<br>
   Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this<br>
   Public License.<br>
   <br>
   b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose<br>
   any additional or different terms or conditions on, or<br>
   apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the<br>
   Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the<br>
   Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed<br>
   Material.<br>
   <br>
   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or<br>
   may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You<br>
   are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected<br>
   with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,<br>
   the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as<br>
   provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).<br>
   <br>
   b. Other rights.<br>
   <br>
   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not<br>
   licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,<br>
   privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to<br>
   the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to<br>
   assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited<br>
   extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed<br>
   Rights, but not otherwise.<br>
   <br>
   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this<br>
   Public License.<br>
   <br>
   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to<br>
   collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed<br>
   Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society<br>
   under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory<br>
   licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly<br>
   reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when<br>
   the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial<br>
   purposes.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   Section 3 -- License Conditions.<br>
   <br>
   Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the<br>
   following conditions.<br>
   <br>
   a. Attribution.<br>
   <br>
   1. If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:<br>
   <br>
   a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor<br>
   with the Licensed Material:<br>
   <br>
   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed<br>
   Material and any others designated to receive<br>
   attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by<br>
   the Licensor (including by pseudonym if<br>
   designated);<br>
   <br>
   ii. a copyright notice;<br>
   <br>
   iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;<br>
   <br>
   iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of<br>
   warranties;<br>
   <br>
   v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the<br>
   extent reasonably practicable;<br>
   <br>
   b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and<br>
   retain an indication of any previous modifications; and<br>
   <br>
   c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this<br>
   Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or<br>
   hyperlink to, this Public License.<br>
   <br>
   For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under<br>
   this Public License to Share Adapted Material.<br>
   <br>
   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any<br>
   reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in<br>
   which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be<br>
   reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or<br>
   hyperlink to a resource that includes the required<br>
   information.<br>
   <br>
   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the<br>
   information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent<br>
   reasonably practicable.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.<br>
   <br>
   Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that<br>
   apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:<br>
   <br>
   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right<br>
   to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial<br>
   portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes<br>
   only and provided You do not Share Adapted Material;<br>
   <br>
   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database<br>
   contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>
   Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>
   Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and<br>
   <br>
   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share<br>
   all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.<br>
   <br>
   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not<br>
   replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed<br>
   Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.<br>
   <br>
   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE<br>
   EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS<br>
   AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF<br>
   ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,<br>
   IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br>
   WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
   PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,<br>
   ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT<br>
   KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT<br>
   ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
   <br>
   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE<br>
   TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br>
   NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,<br>
   INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,<br>
   COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR<br>
   USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN<br>
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR<br>
   DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR<br>
   IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
   <br>
   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided<br>
   above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent<br>
   possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and<br>
   waiver of all liability.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   Section 6 -- Term and Termination.<br>
   <br>
   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and<br>
   Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with<br>
   this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License<br>
   terminate automatically.<br>
   <br>
   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under<br>
   Section 6(a), it reinstates:<br>
   <br>
   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided<br>
   it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the<br>
   violation; or<br>
   <br>
   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.<br>
   <br>
   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any<br>
   right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations<br>
   of this Public License.<br>
   <br>
   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the<br>
   Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop<br>
   distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so<br>
   will not terminate this Public License.<br>
   <br>
   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public<br>
   License.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.<br>
   <br>
   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different<br>
   terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.<br>
   <br>
   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the<br>
   Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and<br>
   independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   Section 8 -- Interpretation.<br>
   <br>
   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and<br>
   shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose<br>
   conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully<br>
   be made without permission under this Public License.<br>
   <br>
   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is<br>
   deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the<br>
   minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision<br>
   cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License<br>
   without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and<br>
   conditions.<br>
   <br>
   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no<br>
   failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the<br>
   Licensor.<br>
   <br>
   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted<br>
   as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities<br>
   that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal<br>
   processes of any jurisdiction or authority.<br>
